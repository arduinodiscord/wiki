To start with, a 9v has 6 individual cells that are a little smaller than an AAA. They produce 1.5v each you get 1.5v X 6 cells = 9v. But this increases the resistance of the battery more so than others. This limits how fast the power can leave the battery, and causes the voltage to &quot;sag&quot; when being used by a high-current device, like a motor.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="inside a 9v" title="inside a 9v"></p><p>These cells are configured in a series connection, not parallel. Series is where positive is connected to negative, positive to negative, and so on.<br> That way, your voltage combines, but the capacity stays the same. A parallel circuit is where positive connects to positive, and negative connects to negative. This way, your capacity adds, and voltage stays the same.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="series-parallel" title="series-parallel"></p><p>This is one of the main reasons why you can&#39;t use a 9v battery, but not the only one.</p><p>A normal Alkaline 9v only has a theoretical 550 mAh worth of power. As you can see in the graph below, you only get to use about 425 mAh, if you only draw 50 mA.</p><p>A Arduino Uno itself, with nothing connected to it, draws 50 mA. This means you would only get a maximum of 7 hours out of it (a Uno needs a minimum of 7v). If you add just 3 LEDs you are now drawing over 100 mA. So that would lower your time down to 2.5 hours.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="9vdiscargrate9vdiscargrate"></p><p><a href="https://odysee.com/@Maderdash:2/9vBattery:0" title="video of 9v battery issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Click for a video with more information.</a></p>',10),c=[l];function h(d,p,u,m,y,v){return t(),a("div",null,c)}const f=e(n,[["render",h]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
