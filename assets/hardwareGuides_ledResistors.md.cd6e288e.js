LEDs work the same way, as they are also diodes.</p><p>When you connect an LED to a circuit, you have a direct link from one leg of the diode to the other. LEDs can not process large amounts of current they are limited to 20ma or less. Although they may try and pass the full current, doing so will cause damage to the LED, or shorten its performance efficiency <em>(or damage/shorten the life of the pin of the Arduino).</em></p><p>To stop this from happening, we use a resistor. This limits the amount of current flowing through the LED, so it lights and doesn&#39;t burn out.</p><hr><h2 id="correct-wiring" tabindex="-1">Correct Wiring <a class="header-anchor" href="#correct-wiring" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>It does not matter, for a single LED, whether you apply the resistor to the GND or the power side.

You <strong>are required</strong> to have your resistors on every segment of the display. This means it requires 7-8 resistors. <em>(depending upon if your display uses decimal or not).</em></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="seven Segment Display" title="correct wiring for a display"></p><hr><p>You <strong>do not</strong> want to use a resistor on the common pin of the display.</p><p>The reason for this is found in the math. If you look at the example above, you can see that each segment only has 8ma passing through it. It does not matter if one segment is lit, or if all seven are. Each one is limited and controlled to 8ma.</p><p>If you place a resistor on the common pin, then the current will change each time a segment is lit.</p><p>With one segment lit, there will be 8ma passing through it. When you light two, then the segments will get dimmer, because there is only 4ma passing through each one.</p><p>If you light all eight segments, then you will only have 1ma passing through each one. This is why we do not use a resistor on the single common pin.</p><h2 id="led-color-matters" tabindex="-1">LED Color Matters <a class="header-anchor" href="#led-color-matters" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Each LED has a <em>forward voltage.</em> <em>Forward voltage</em> is the required voltage level that the LED needs before it starts conducting current through it.</p><p>Below is a chart of the common colors, with their forward voltage requirements. If you can find a data sheet for your LED, it is best to go by that. If not, the chart will assist you in your resistor math.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="led Chart" title="led color chart"></p><h2 id="resistor-math-time" tabindex="-1">Resistor Math Time <a class="header-anchor" href="#resistor-math-time" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="we-will-see-an-example-of-voltage-drop" tabindex="-1"><em>We will see an example of voltage drop</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#we-will-see-an-example-of-voltage-drop" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>If you have a supply voltage of 5v, and you have a red LED, we will say the forward voltage is 2.0v.
