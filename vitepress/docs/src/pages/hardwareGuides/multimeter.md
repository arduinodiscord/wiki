# Multimeter Guide { .text-[#e67e22] }

## What is a Multimeter?

A **multimeter** is an essential tool for anyone working with electronics. It allows you to measure:

- **Voltage** (V) - electrical potential difference
- **Current** (A) - flow of electrical charge
- **Resistance** (Ω) - opposition to current flow

## Safety First

Always start with the highest range setting and work your way down. This prevents damage to the multimeter and ensures accurate readings.

## Measuring Voltage

1. Set the multimeter to voltage mode (V)
2. Connect the red probe to the positive terminal
3. Connect the black probe to the negative terminal or ground
4. Read the display

## Measuring Current

1. Set the multimeter to current mode (A)
2. Break the circuit and connect the multimeter in series
3. Connect the red probe to the positive side
4. Connect the black probe to the negative side
5. Read the display

## Measuring Resistance

1. Set the multimeter to resistance mode (Ω)
2. Connect the probes to the component
3. Read the display

## Continuity Test

Use the continuity mode (usually indicated by a sound wave symbol) to test if a connection is complete. The multimeter will beep if there's continuity.

## Common Symbols

- V = Voltage
- A = Current
- Ω = Resistance
- ~ = AC (alternating current)
- — = DC (direct current)
