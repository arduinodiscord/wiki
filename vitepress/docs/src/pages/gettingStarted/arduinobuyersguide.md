# Arduino Buyers Guide  | [HOME](README.md) |


### This is a guide on all the different Arduino's

The Arduino Uno is the most common Arduino because it has a normal amount of IO. Also, there is no need to solder

The Leonardo has the same form-factor as the Uno but can be used as an HID device, like a game-pad or "button-box" and such

The Mega 2560 is extremely common. It has over three times IO than the UNO. If you need a lot of LEDs, or pins to use, the MEGA is a good choice for this

The Micro is good to use on a breadboard. Also compact this has the same chip as the Leonardo

The Due also has a lot of IO, has more memory than the Mega 2560 which also makes it a great starter board

The nano has the same chip as the Uno so can be used in a final product. Many times it's easiest to prototype on an UNO, then when all the debugging is done, use the NANO for the final product

The Zero uses 3.3v instead of the normal 5v. Also is a 32-bit board so it can process a lot faster.
