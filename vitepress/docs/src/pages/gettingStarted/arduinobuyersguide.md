# Arduino Buyers Guide  | [HOME](README.md) |


### This is a guide on all the different Arduino's

### The Arduino Uno is the most common Arduino because it has a normal amount of IO. Also, there is no need to solder

### The Leonardo has the same form-factor as the Uno but can be used as an HID device, like a game-pad or "button-box" and such

### The Mega 2560 is extremely common. It has over three times IO than the UNO. If you need a lot of LEDs, or pins to use, the MEGA is a good choice for this

### The Micro is good to use on a breadboard. Also compact this has the same chip as the Leonardo

### The Due also has a lot of IO, has more memory than the Mega 2560 which also makes it a great starter board

### The nano has the same chip as the Uno so can be used in a final product. Many times it's easiest to prototype on an UNO, then when all the debugging is done, use the NANO for the final product

### The Zero uses 3.3v instead of the normal 5v. Also is a 32-bit board so it can process a lot faster.
